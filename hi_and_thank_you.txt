Hi ilmoi, 

I am just writing to thank you - one of your many tools (NFTArmory) has been a huge help in the creation of my collection
[mostly for having all the minted NFT's data/addresses in one neat folder]
(really - I had difficulty finding a tool that could properly query my entire collection - kind of disappointed with SOLANA - the NFT creation process is meh at best.)

Just wanted to say that I am truly grateful for the obvious efforts you've put towards your tool, and would like to send you a few NFT's as a token of my appreciation.

I don't use Twitter so I apologize for this method of contacting!

Please feel free to add me on discord at Oasis Cover Band#9047 to pass me your Solana address <3
or you can find me here https://discord.gg/superpixelers

Once again - thank you so much for your amazing work - it's truly appreciated and by far the best NFT metadata tool I could find - you are truly special!

Thanks a million.
